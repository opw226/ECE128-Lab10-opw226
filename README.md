The purpose of this lab was for students to design a multiplier which can multiply two numbers. However, this multiplier implements storing data, and uses a ROM and a RAM. This lab also implements a register file and a control unit to aid with the overall machine, but these were given. The students were to design a RAM that is able to read and write 8-bit width data and store them into 8 different memory locations. The students were to design a ROM that can store 4-bit width data into 8 different memory locations as well. The students then had to design an overall top module with a multiplier that implemented all of the separate modules together. This lab helped the students understand how to store data in different memory locations.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/760bfa9e-074b-48bf-aa86-1090e0795093)
